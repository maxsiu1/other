This is a website I did for fun to practice HTML/CSS. It is dedicated to my "Dota 2" team. Enjoy...

---UPDATE LOG---
* 1.0v -> Website deployed.You can read some info about the team, view the trophies earned and check the player profiles. Some technical issues but website is ready to use. Date: 

* 1.1v -> Game statistics updated. New player profile design. "LMAO" page added. Website is now more optimised for small screen sizes (looks much better on phones).

* 1.2v ->

--- IDEAS (Possible Updates) ---
! Make links to players in "Trophies"
! Automatically update statistics (super hard)
! Fix trophies bug (in player bio)
! Fix trophies page (small screen sizes)
